**Question 1:** Why is it important to have a formal problem formulation before applying a search algorithm? What would happen if any of the five components (initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, path cost) were missing or incorrectly defined?

**Question 2:** In the 8-puzzle, we represent states as tuples of 9 numbers. What are the advantages of this representation compared to using a 2D array or other data structures? Consider both computational efficiency and ease of use.

**Question 3:** The transition model in our implementation checks whether moves are valid before executing them. Why is it important for the `get_actions()` method to only return valid actions rather than returning all possible actions and letting the search algorithm handle invalid ones?
