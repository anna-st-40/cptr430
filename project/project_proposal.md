# Project Proposal: Computer Science AI Advisor

## Goal:
Build an application that builds your class schedule for you based on different factors and personal preferences

## Details
  - Narrow it down to build a schedule for CS majors, then we can add more features
  - Have the user upload their transcript, parse it and figure what classes they have taken and what classed they still need to take
  - Consider general classes, core requirements, cognates
  - For now, just BS in Computer Science, linked to 23-24 bulletin

## TODO
 - Add more things
