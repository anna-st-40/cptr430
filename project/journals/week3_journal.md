# Week 3 Journal
## AI Advisor
## January 26, 2026
## Jaime Garcia, Anna Stefaniv Oickle 

## Progress made this week
This week, Anna met with James Foster, contract professor of Computer Science, who has access to the `schedule.cs.wallawalla.edu` codebase hosted on GitLab. We were able to get developer access to the GitLab repository. We will work towards implementing our AI advisor on the currently deployed website mentioned above. Anna made some progresss on enhancing the _Upload a PDF_ page and get it to load, parse, and display the user's transcript.

## Goal for next week
Our goal for next week is to make some more UI enhancings and start working towards parsing the data that is fetched from `classopen.wallawalla.edu`, load it into a vector database so that our future chatbot is able to read from the database. We also have to load the user's transcript (classes taken) into another vector database so the LLM or logic can deduct the user's class standing, and suggest classes based on that.

## Next steps
Next week's journal will be improved, including a better formatting and more details regarding the project status.
